        <h1>Markhor</h1>
        <h2>Markhor is the national animal of Pakistan</h2>
        <p class="intro">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markhor" class="markhor">Markhor</a> (Capra
            falconeri) /ˈmɑːrkɔːr/ is a large Capra species native to Central Asia, the Karakoram, and the Himalayas. It
            is listed on the IUCN Red List as
            Near Threatened since 2015.[2]

            The is the national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known as the screw horn or "screw-horned goat",[3]
            mārkhor (مارخور) in Urdu from Classical Persian.[4]</p>
        <h3>Behaviour and Ecology</h3>
        <p class="second">Markhor are adapted to mountainous terrain, and can be found between 600 and 3,600 m (2,000 and 11,800 ft) in
            elevation.
            They typically inhabit scrub forests made up primarily of oaks (Quercus ilex), pines (Pinus gerardiana), and
            junipers (Juniperus
            macropoda).[2] They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets
            shift seasonally: in
            the spring and summer periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind
            legs to reach high branches.
            The mating season takes place in winter, during which the males fight each other by lunging, locking horns
            and attempting to push each other off balance.
            The gestation period lasts 135–170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, though rarely
            three. Markhor live in flocks, usually numbering nine animals,
            composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise
            most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% of the population and kids making up 31%.
            Adult males comprise 19%, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make
            up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) make up 9% of the population.[9] Their alarm call closely
            resembles the bleating of domestic goats.[5] Early in the season the males
            and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among
            the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest,
            while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above</p>
